jquery-couchsurfing-widget
==========================

Add a couchsurfing profile widget to your page with one tag.

---

To use this widget, include on your page:

    <div class="couchsurfing-widget" data-username="joeframbach"></div>

Just be sure to change the username as appropriate and remember to include the .js file. Don't worry about the css file, it will be dynamically loaded.

Couchsurfing doesn't have an API so I faked one with YQL and JQuery, so it's probably going to be finicky.
